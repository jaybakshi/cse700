# cse700

This was my Master's Project for MS in CS, SUNY University at Buffalo during Spring 2018.

The notebooks are fairly annotated to be self-explanatory.

Files list -
1. AlexNet.ipnyb - I implemented the AlexNet model from scratch using Keras.
2. VGG16.ipnyb - I implemented the VGG16 model from scratch using Keras.
3. Grad-CAM.ipnyb - I applied the Grad-CAM technique on the model predictions as seen in the notebooks above to generate heat-map helping derive insights of the inner workings of the neural networks label predictions.
4. Report.pdf - The report explains all the process and the findings for each stage. It also lists all the references used.

How to read through the project -
1. Please read the Report.pdf first to understand the problem statements and necessary steps and setups required.
2. The Jupyter Notebooks have the relevant code.
